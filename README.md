# raytracing
Forked originally from rossant/raytracing.py (https://gist.github.com/rossant/6046463) Very simple ray tracing engine in (almost) pure Python. Depends on NumPy and Matplotlib. Diffuse and specular lighting, simple shadows, reflections, no refraction. Purely sequential algorithm, slow execution. The goal is to add refraction
